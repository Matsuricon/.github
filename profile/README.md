# Welcome to Matsuricon!

Welcome to the Matsuricon GitHub profile! 

Matsuricon is an annual Japanese pop-culture event featuring anime, manga, and video games. We also showcase American and Japanese popular culture to celebrate the overlap of fandom between the two genres.

## Our Event

Our flagship event is a three-day convention held in Columbus, Ohio, featuring guests, panels, workshops, and a wide variety of other events and activities centered around Japanese pop culture. We are considered a "family friendly" event and most of our panels are all ages, unless otherwise stated. We do have certain events that are not appropriate for attendees under the age of 18, and our convention staff check IDs at the door to these events. In line with our "family friendly" image, our mascots are a traditional Japanese family consisting of a father, mother, son, daughter, and dog.

## Matsuricon Charity

Matsuricon Charity is the charitable arm of Matsuricon focused on collecting money throughout the year to donate it to the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The James. We are proud to donate every dollar we collect towards this research in the hopes that someday, we can meet someone who hasn’t been affected by this horrible disease. 

## Our Team

Matsuricon is run by a dedicated team of volunteers who are passionate about bringing the best possible convention experience to our attendees.
